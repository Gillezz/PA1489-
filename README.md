Project summary
The project is designed to simulate the operations of a burger chain, offering customers the flexibility to create their perfect burger by selecting and removing specific ingredients. The user-friendly interface enhances the ordering experience by allowing for customizations, while the kitchen view displays live orders for staff, ensuring they can efficiently prepare each order. This dual functionality not only improves customer satisfaction but also optimizes kitchen workflow, making it easier to manage orders and maintain high service standards in a fast-paced environment.
