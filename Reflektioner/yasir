# Yasir reflections diary

We have decided to use HTML and Python for this course. In the beginning, it was quite hard to start the work because we didn't know what to do and how to start the project. After some meetings with the whole group, we decided to divide the work among us, and each person had the responsibility for something. Each one of us took their part very seriously, even though it was very hard for us at the beginning. Each day, we began to see some results, and that made us even more confident in the work we were doing. All of us tried very hard and did our best to learn and to be part of the project in different ways.

I started by watching different videos about how to start a project using Git and GitHub. I also read a lot of articles and PowerPoints from each lecture that the teacher posted on Canvas. I did all that in the beginning just to get to know a bit about how everything was going to be and to gather some information about how projects were made. I will be fully honest: what I watched in the beginning on YouTube and how the project was when we started were quite different in many ways and aspects.
