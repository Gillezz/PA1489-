### Debugging Session Output`

#### Observations
- **Initial Value**: `DATABASE = "burger"`
  - The database was created successfully with the name "burger".
  - `DATABASE_URL` was set to `mysql+mysqldb://root:password@localhost:3306/burger`.

- **Modified Value**: `DATABASE = "bläää"`
  - The database was created successfully with the name "bläää".
  - `DATABASE_URL` was set to `mysql+mysqldb://root:password@localhost:3306/bläää`.

#### Summary and Reflection
- **What went well?**: watched variables, and stepped through the code.
- **What was challenging?**: Running through all brekpoints, understanding the flow of the program and the impact of each line.
- **Usefulness of Debugging**: Debugging is a powerful tool for identifying and fixing issues in the code. It helps in understanding the program flow and the state of variables at different points in execution.

### Conclusion
Debugging proved to be an invaluable tool for understanding and verifying the functionality of the `create_database_if_not_exists` function. By modifying the `DATABASE` variable and observing the changes, I gained insights into how different database names affect the execution of the code. This exercise has enhanced my confidence in using debugging as a tool for future projects.
