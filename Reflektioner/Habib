# Habib reflections
#we have decided that we  use Github and Git for our group project.Initially i had no idea how to use them,so i created a github account.
#I was invitedto a repository by my groupmember Samuel who had created it and invited all the group member.
#I had alot of trouble with Git command at first as i did not know how to navegate through it so i watched alot of tutorial videos.
#I eventually learned  how to move through my files and understand where i was. first i ran git pull using the repository url  to download the files
#After that i made some change to one of file to try ou commiting.Once i ensuredthat i was in the right directory i used git commit -m with 
#a massage,follwed by git push to upload the changes. I successfully did my first cimmit


Git Commands: 
i used all these commands to navigate throuht  git in order to commit or open files or pull
ls =to know where you are and wich folder you have 
cd "file name" =you open the file
cd ..= you backing up from the file
git status = can be used to get a summery of which file have changes that are staged for the commit
git pull =you use this with the url link to get the files from repository .I used it and put my files in the foder to commit
git commit= when you are ready to commit the snapshot of the staged change
git push = you send it to the repository

#Html Burger Menu:
I decided to take responsibilty for the burgermenu. i alredy had visual  studio code istalled,so i started with html code.
I had no idea how html worked  so i went to looked it up and began working on the menu i added three burger
i added three burgers: Classic hamburgare,cheeseburgare,Veggie burgare and i added a checkbox in evrey burger menu.
It was a bit challenging from start to finish, especially when i added chechboxes to each nurger option.the checkboxes
contain three alternatives for each burger menu. It took a while to get it done.

 


Problems
througout our project, we have encounterd sevrel challenges,particularly in understanding the scope and requirements of the project abd determining where to begin setting up the kitchen view using Flask and configuirng the necessary envoiroment posted significant difficulties,especially when istalling  required packeges such as pip and Myqsl.
despite initial setbacks , we were able to run both the database and the burger menu , though this process was not without its complations.One of the significant challenges we faced was creating containers for different parts of the project. After 
careful consideration ,we decided to implement Docker to manage these containers .Our solution  involved cretaing three seperate containers : One for the frontend ,one for the backend and one for the database.
however , creating Docker containers images proved to be highly complex and added another layer of the defficulty to the process.We used the Docker build ., command to build the image ,which works if a Dockerfile has been properly created in the project files.Additionally  docker ps .was useful for displaying the running containers and their IDs, while docker images. allowed us to check how many images we had and view their corresponding IDS. I used docker-compose build to  make the coantains and docker-compose up
docker commands:
docker ps 
docker build.
docker images
docker start
docker stop  
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
these are the command that we have used in order to create the images and the containers.


Test and debugigng :
when i created a contain for kitchenvew and statred to analyis and debug it it had over 121 Vulnerabilites and over 594 packages whcih i had no idea how to fix it or what was causing the issues 

Projects:
 we have used alot of  tools  in order to get done our porject such as Git,Github,Visual studio code,database,Docker desktop,pip,flask
