'Git commmands:
            git pull - Fetch git from a repository
            git push - Upload a file to github
            git commit - updating a file (changes, removing and adding code counts as a commit)
            git add * - add a file
            git touch - create a empty file'

Reflektion:
            we have learned how to use git and github, we have learned how to create a repository and how to add a file to it.
            we have also learned how to push and pull files from a repository.
            we have also learned how to commit changes to a file.
            we have also learnde how to create a empty file.
            we have also learned how to add a file to a repository.
            we have also learned how to remove a file from a repository.
            we have also learned how to clone a repository.

Projects:
            we have worked together on the project and each coded a part of the project.
            The following projects have been made: Database, Burgerorder, index, menu and a kitchenview.
            I have coded the kitchenview and created the repository for the project.

Problems:
            we have had some problems with the project mainly with understanding the assignment and how to code each project.
            we have also had some problems with git and github but we have managed to sovle them.
            we have also had some problems with understanding the code and how to use it.
            some of the problems have been solved by asking the teacher for help and some have been solved by searching on the internet.

Left to do:
Debugging the project testing what works and what does not work. 
Before the project is finished we need to create a container for the project.
