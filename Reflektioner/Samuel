# Samuels reflektion
# Each one in the group has commited and pushed a git repository
# We have created a new repository and added a file to it

Group memmbers: Habib, Sebastian, Samuel and Yasir.

We started the project thinking about setting up all the work and assigning the tasks to each other. Over the cousrse we have constantly worked together even if we faced hardships we got through. The task is about building a website containing a burgerorder. we also needed a container and debugging. 

Some things we have learned:

'Git commmands:
            git pull - Fetch git from a repository
            git push - Upload a file to github
            git commit - updating a file (changes, removing and adding code counts as a commit)
            git add * - add a file
            git touch - create a empty file'

Reflektion:
            we have learned how to use git and github, we have learned how to create a repository and how to add a file to it.
            we have also learned how to push and pull files from a repository.
            we have also learned how to commit changes to a file.
            we have also learnde how to create a empty file.
            we have also learned how to add a file to a repository.
            we have also learned how to remove a file from a repository.
            we have also learned how to clone a repository.

Projects:
            we have worked together on the project and each coded a part of the project.
            The following projects have been made: Database, Burgerorder, index, menu and a kitchenview.
            I have coded the kitchenview and created the repository for the project.

Problems:
            we have had some problems with the project mainly with understanding the assignment and how to code each project.
            we have also had some problems with git and github but we have managed to sovle them.
            we have also had some problems with understanding the code and how to use it.
            some of the problems have been solved by asking the teacher for help and some have been solved by searching on the internet.

Containers: We have uesd containers and managed to get the files working inside of them.
Debugging:  We have managed to just touch the tip of the debbuggings and run some tests but not much.

Overall: The course have been very challenging and my personal opnion a bit too early for us newcommers. On the other hand iv'e learned a lot and iv'e got to know some people.
